DEBUGGING:

Preperations:
-Open a command window in the repository root
-Type: vagrant up
-Wait for vagrant to have booted the Virtual Machine
-Open the rpgxef.sln in Visual Studio
-Open the Visual Studio Command Window (View -> Other Windows -> Command Window)

Debugging:
You have two options here, debuggin with RPG-X running inside the Virtual Machine desktop or streaming the RPG-X window via X.
I personally recommend running it inside the Virtual Machine and using VirtualBox to open the machine's desktop.
Whichever way you chose, enter one of the following commands into the Visual Studio Command Window and press enter.

1. For debugging with RPG-X EF running inside the Virtual Machine 
(faster rendering, butter mouse handeling, but you need to go trough the VirutalBox UI and open a "remote desktop" 
to your VM by double clicking on it and make sure Input -> Mouse Integration is turned OFF and 
"uncapture" your mouse every time you want to switch mouse focus back to your actual desktop)

Debug.MIDebugLaunch /OptionsFile:GDBVM.xml /Executable:rpgxef

2. For debugging with Xming, launch Xming using the rpgxefXming.launch profile provided in the same folder as this document
(slower rendering and clumbsier mouse handeling, but you don't need to manually go into the VM)

Debug.MIDebugLaunch /OptionsFile:GDBXming.xml /Executable:rpgxef

HELP, IT DOES NOT WORK:

-Make sure you have all dependencies installed above. plink should be added to your PATH. 
 The putty-installer does this by default make sure to add the PuTTY installation directory to your PATH (by default installed in C:\Program Files (x86)\PuTTY).
 I'm not going to tell you how to do this, if you don't know how to add something to your PATH, you really shouln't be reading this file anyway.

-Make sure the ssh IP Adress of your VM is correct. By default, you can ssh to the VM at 127.0.0.1:2222
 If, for any reason, you changed this, make sure to update the port and/or IP in the PipeArguments in the GDB<Version>.xml files
